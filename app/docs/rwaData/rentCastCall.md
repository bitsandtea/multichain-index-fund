# RentCast Property Valuation and Risk Assessment Flow

## Overview

This system enhances property valuations and default risk assessments by combining property data from RentCast API with AI-powered analysis.

## Input Data Structure

The system accepts an array of property objects containing:

- `property_id`: Unique identifier for the property
- `address`: Full property address
- `valuation_usd`: Current valuation estimate
- `size_sqm`: Property size in square meters
- `default_risk_score`: Current default risk assessment (0-1 scale)

## Data Enrichment Flow

### Step 1: Property Data Fetching

For each property in the input array:

1. **Address Validation**: Parse and validate the provided address
2. **RentCast API Integration**: Query RentCast endpoints to fetch:
   - Property details (bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, property type)
   - Recent sale history and transaction data
   - Tax assessment history and current assessments
   - Property features (amenities, construction type, etc.)
   - Market trends for the specific location
   - Comparable property sales in the area
   - Rental market data and trends
   - Neighborhood demographics and economic indicators

### Step 2: Market Context Gathering

For each property location:

1. **Geographic Analysis**: Extract city, state, zip code, and county data
2. **Market Data Collection**: Fetch:
   - Local real estate market trends
   - Economic indicators (employment rates, income levels)
   - Property tax rates and assessment methodologies
   - Zoning information and development restrictions
   - Infrastructure and transportation data
   - School district ratings and quality metrics

### Step 3: Risk Factor Analysis

For each property:

1. **Financial Risk Indicators**: Analyze:

   - Property tax burden relative to valuation
   - Market volatility in the area
   - Economic stability of the region
   - Property age and maintenance requirements
   - Insurance costs and natural disaster risks

2. **Market Risk Assessment**: Evaluate:
   - Supply and demand dynamics in the local market
   - Price appreciation/depreciation trends
   - Rental yield potential vs. ownership costs
   - Market liquidity and time-to-sale metrics

## AI Agent Processing

### Step 4: Data Aggregation

Combine all collected data into a comprehensive property profile:

- Original input data (valuation, size, risk score)
- RentCast API data (property details, history, features)
- Market context data (trends, demographics, economics)
- Risk factor analysis results

### Step 5: AI Analysis Prompt

Feed the aggregated data to an AI agent with a structured prompt that:

1. **Valuation Enhancement**:

   - Compare current valuation against market comparables
   - Analyze property-specific factors affecting value
   - Consider market trends and timing factors
   - Account for unique property features and amenities
   - Factor in location-specific market dynamics

2. **Risk Score Refinement**:
   - Evaluate default probability based on market conditions
   - Assess property-specific risk factors
   - Consider economic and demographic risk indicators
   - Analyze historical performance patterns
   - Factor in market volatility and liquidity risks

### Step 6: AI Output Generation

The AI agent produces enhanced outputs:

- **Improved Valuation**: More accurate market value estimate with confidence intervals
- **Refined Risk Score**: Updated default risk assessment with detailed risk factors
- **Justification**: Detailed explanation of valuation and risk adjustments
- **Market Insights**: Key factors influencing the property's performance

## Output Structure

### Enhanced Property Data

Each property receives updated information:

- `enhanced_valuation_usd`: AI-refined property value
- `valuation_confidence`: Confidence level in the valuation (0-1)
- `refined_risk_score`: Updated default risk assessment
- `risk_factors`: Detailed breakdown of risk components
- `market_insights`: Key market factors affecting the property
- `valuation_methodology`: Explanation of valuation approach
- `data_sources`: List of data sources used in analysis

### Quality Assurance

- Validation of AI outputs against market benchmarks
- Consistency checks across similar properties
- Confidence scoring for each assessment
- Flagging of unusual valuations or risk scores for manual review

## Integration Requirements

### API Dependencies

- RentCast Property Data API
- Market data providers
- Economic indicators API
- Geographic and demographic data sources

### AI Agent Requirements

- Large language model with real estate expertise
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent outputs
- Validation and quality control mechanisms
- Explainable AI capabilities for transparency

### Performance Considerations

- Batch processing for multiple properties
- Caching of market data to reduce API calls
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Scalability for large property portfolios

## Success Metrics

- Improved valuation accuracy compared to initial estimates
- Better risk assessment correlation with actual default rates
- Reduced variance in assessments across similar properties
- Increased confidence in investment decisions
- Transparent and explainable assessment methodology
