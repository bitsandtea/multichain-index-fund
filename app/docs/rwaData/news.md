# News Sentiment Index for City/Area

## Objective
Generate a quantitative index (range: -1 to +1) reflecting the overall sentiment of news coverage for a given city or area. This index can be used to inform property valuation, risk assessment, and market analysis.

## How to Compute the News Sentiment Index

### 1. News Data Collection
- Use a news aggregation API to fetch recent news articles for the target city/area.
- Query parameters:
  - City or area name (and optionally state/country)
  - Date range (e.g., last 30-90 days)
  - Language (e.g., English)
  - Optional: filter by relevant topics (real estate, economy, crime, development, infrastructure)

### 2. Article Filtering
- Remove irrelevant articles (sports, entertainment, etc.)
- Focus on business, economic, development, and local news

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- For each article, analyze the headline and main content using a sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or a cloud NLP API)
- Assign a sentiment score to each article (-1 = very negative, 0 = neutral, +1 = very positive)
- Optionally, classify articles by category (economic, safety, development, real estate)

### 4. Index Calculation
- Weight recent articles more heavily (e.g., exponential decay by recency)
- Compute the weighted average sentiment score for all articles
- Optionally, compute separate indices for each category
- Output:
  - `news_sentiment_index`: overall score (-1 to +1)
  - `category_scores`: per-category sentiment
  - `confidence`: based on article count and recency

### 5. Integration
- Use the index as a feature in property valuation and risk models
- Track index trends over time for market monitoring

## Example Output
```json
{
  "city": "San Francisco, CA",
  "news_sentiment_index": 0.18,
  "category_scores": {
    "economic": 0.22,
    "safety": -0.09,
    "development": 0.31,
    "real_estate": 0.12
  },
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "article_count": 54,
  "date_range": "2024-05-01 to 2024-06-01"
}
```
